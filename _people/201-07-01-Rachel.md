Rachel’s research is focused on the mechanisms by which melanocytes receive and process information from adjacent cells within human skin and how homeostatic destabilization through melanoma associated mutations alters these processes.  She uses a host of fluorescence microscopy imaging techniques to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual melanocyte responses to cell-cell signaling events.

Rachel received her B.S. in Biochemisty from Cook College, Rutgers University where she did her undergraduate research thesis work on the volume changes associated with conformation transitions of the protein β-lactoglobulin using dilatometry and various spectroscopy techniques. She then went on to receive her Ph.D at The Rockefeller University with Dr. Sanford Simon, in the Laboratory of Cellular Biophysics, where she developed and utilized multi-cellular culturing systems to investigate primary human melanocyte – keratinocyte intercellular communication.
