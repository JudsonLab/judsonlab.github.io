Andrew explores the functional roles of microRNAs in human melanocytes.  He is specifically interested in understanding how microRNAs coordinate with genetic mutations during the formation of melanocytic lesions in the skin, such as benign human nevi (moles) and melanoma. 

Prior to joining the Judson Lab, Andrew received his BA in history from Haverford College where he wrote a senior thesis untangling the complex relationships between science and politics in England during the cholera epidemics of the 1880s.  After graduation, Andrew decided to pursue cancer research, joining Dr. Todd Ridky’s lab at the University of Pennsylvania.  As the lab’s inaugural member, he led efforts to model melanoma initiation and progression using patient-derived reconstituted human skin.  Andrew’s research highlighted the functional importance of CDKN2B as a tumor suppressor in melanocytes and as a marker of melanoma progression.
