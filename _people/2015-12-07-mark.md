Hanlin investigates the interactions of established oncogenic mutations in normal human melanocytes. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing techniques to engineer isogenic lines of understudied melanoma subtypes and stages, Hanlin dissects the distribution of cellular phenotypes introduced by each individual or combination of oncogenic mutations.
Hanlin received his B.S. in bioengineering from China Pharmaceutical University (CPU), before continuing to earn his Ph.D. at Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica (SIMM), Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most renowned research institutes dedicated to cancer drug discovery in China. At SIMM, he conducted his graduate research with Dr. Jiang Ding and Dr. Meiyu Geng to explore the mechanism of cancer drug resistance and rationally design combination therapies for clinical application. He focused on elucidating the primary mechanisms of resistance to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) in cancer and developed drug combinations to overcome this resistance. Meanwhile, he also collaborated with a computational group to model cancer signaling networks in order to [predict novel combinatorial anti-cancer targets](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14739). In parallel, he characterized a novel site of SOD1 acetylation and discovered [the biological function and the correlation to cancer chemoresistance]( http://www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/index.php?journal=oncotarget&page=article&op=view&path[]=3987&pubmed-linkout=1).
