Rodrigo investigates the utility of miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers for melanoma initiation through novel assay development and computational approaches. He is exploring non-invasive miRNA-monitoring techniques and aims to improve melanoma diagnosis and monitoring.

Rodrigo received his B.A. at UC Irvine where he did undergraduate research using x-ray crystallography to study a novel immune resistance pathway in Yersinia pestis. He then got his Ph.D at UC Irvine with Dr. Celia Goulding where he used structural biology and biochemical techniques to characterize a bacterial pathogenesis system in Y. pestis with implications for use as a broad-spectrum antibiotic. He then continued his work at UC Irvine under Dr. Celia Goulding with postdoctoral working to characterize a Mycobacterial tuberculosis family of transporters with promise as anti-tuberculosis drug targets.
