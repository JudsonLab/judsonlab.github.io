Robert is a [Sandler Fellow](http://fellows.ucsf.edu/) in the Department of Dermatology at UCSF.

Robert’s research interests focus on the networks of genes and environmental factors that stabilize cell states in adult mammalian organisms, and, conversely, the coordinated sets of destabilizing factors which can lead to tumorigenesis.

Robert is also actively involved with exploring new models of scientific training, communication and publication, including experimenting with forums for post-publication peer review, reproducibility initiatives, and strategies for training the scientific workforce that reflect the needs outlined by the [NIH Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group Report](http://acd.od.nih.gov/Biomedical_research_wgreport.pdf).

Robert received his B.A. in Molecular Biology & Biochemistry from Wesleyan University in MIddletown, CT. His undergraduate research  in the lab of Dr. John Casey focused on how changes in the secondary structure of the HDV genome altered viral replication. He then studied the effect of nucleosome positioning on HIV and retrotransposon integration as a fellow in the lab of Dr. Henry Levin at the NIH in Bethesda, MD. Robert conducted his graduate work in the Biomedical Sciences program at UCSF working with Dr. Robert Blelloch, where he explored the role and mechanism of microRNA-mediated somatic cell reprogramming. Following a postdoctoral training period with Dr. Boris Bastian, Robert now leads a research group in the [Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Research Center](http://cancer.ucsf.edu/) on the UCSF Mission Bay campus.

Robert’s research has been generously funded by the [DP5 NIH Director’s Early Independence Award](http://commonfund.nih.gov/earlyindependence/index), the [UCSF Sandler Fellows Program](http://fellows.ucsf.edu/), the UCSF Department of Dermatology, the [Northern California Association of Phi Beta Kappa](http://www.pbknca.org/), the Julius R. and Patricia A. Krevans Fellowship, the UC Cancer Research Coordinating Committee and the [National Sciences Foundation](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
