In this report, Iwei Yeh and her group identify a combination of mutations that are common to deep penetrating nevi – a class of melanocytic lesions characterized by enlarged melanocytes that extend through the dermis. They find that deep penetrating nevi have an addition B-catenin pathway mutation, in addition to the activating BRAF mutations found in most common nevi.  We helped to show that engineering these alterations in cultured cells results in the same increase in pigmentation and cell volume that distinguish deep penetrating nevi from other types of lesions.
