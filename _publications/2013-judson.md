In retrospect, this paper probably got a little too large. It contains four intertwined lines of experiments and conclusions that, although interdependent, deserve to be highlighted individually. The first is a simple, but unexpected, conclusion - the miR-181 family can facilitate reprogramming into iPSCs and their endogenous expression is an important regulator of the process, downstream of Oct4, Sox2 & Klf4. This is surprising because miR-181 has also been shown to induce differentiation when overexpressed in ESCs. The second is that these miRNAs, as well as the previously identified miR-294 / miR-302 miRNAs, enhance reprogramming during the early stages of the process, through destabilization of the fibroblastic program. They play a role in initiation the process, but not thereafter. The third is that the targets of microRNAs are enriched for genes with genetic interactions - this paper contains one of the first published functional genetic interaction maps in a mammalian system. The fourth is that the miRNAs have their effect on reprogramming through simultaneous regulation of at least three signaling pathways. Together, these observations, combined with previously published studies, suggest an interesting model, whereby aberrantly expressed microRNAs destabilize a cellâ€™s endogenous program through co-inhibition of many genes involved in several different cellular processes. This destabilization then sensitizes a cell to epigenetic reprogramming. In the case of miR-294 / miR-302, this destabilization is sufficient to permit changes in the growth media to fully reprogram fibroblasts to a pluripotent state. In the case or miR-181, a miRNA normally expressed in the brain and immune system, both the fibroblast program and the pluripotency program are destabilized, such that transient expressed aids in OSK-induced de-differentiation, but prolonged expression has deleterious effects. Regardless of whether this proves to be the correct model to explain these data, the study does show that microRNAs are excellent tools for discovering novel functional genetic interactions.
