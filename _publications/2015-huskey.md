Here, Noelle reports a thorough dissection of the machinery that makes the unique stem-cell cell-cycle unique. She finds that CDK1, but not other CDKs, is critical specifically for the cell cycle of pluripotent stem cells. Knock-down of CDK1 or associated cyclins selectively altered the cell cycle, induced DNA damage and caused apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiating cells. She then establishes a potential biomedical use for this observation, finding that CDK1 inhibitors prevent stem cell-derived tumors as well as further growth of previously established tumors.
