This mammoth report was the consequence of a multi-lab collaboration spearheaded by Alex, Susie and Andrei. They identified a novel oncomir - miR-380-5p, which inhibits p53 expression, thereby protecting against apoptosis. The microRNA cooperates with other oncogenes to transform cells, and itâ€™s expression is correlated with poor outcome in subsets of neuroblastomas. Interesting, like other identified oncomirs, miR-380-5p is also normally expressed in ESCs - suggesting that neurblastoma progression is accompanied by stabilization of programs normally found early in development.
