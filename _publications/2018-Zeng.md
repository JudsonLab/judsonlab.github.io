Freshly isolated primary melanocytes are genetically engineered with CRISPR/Cas9 to harbor melanoma associated mutations at endogenous loci. The influence of the mutation on cell behavior and morphology is monitored with digital holographic cytometry.

An exciting team effort spear-headed by Mark Zeng. Mark developed a new model system for studying the effects of common melanoma mutations. Beginning with primary human melanocytes isolated from skin, Mark used CRISPR/CAS9 to introduce either the activating BRAFV600E driver mutation and/or the deletion of the CDKN2A locus - a secondary mutation. Using digital holography to monitor the effect of each mutation with single cell resolution, we made the unexpected observation that loss of the cell cycle inhibitor, p16INK4A (from the CDKN2A locus) resulted in a profound increase in melanocyte motility, invasion and metastasis. Mark used this system to chase down the mechanism, ultimately identifying a known master regulator of melanocyte motility, BRN2, as a new cell-type restricted target of E2F1. 

We are excited to move forward with this new system, as it provides us the flexibility to study many oncogenic mutations under endogenous regulation in human melanocytes from diverse genetic backgrounds and anatomical areas.
