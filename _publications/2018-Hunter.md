Following their [2015 New England Journal of Medicine report](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1502583) that delineated the genetic evolution of melanoma from benign precursors, Hunter Shain and Boris Bastian now add in transcriptomics to this database. They observe that MAPK pathway output progressively ramps up during progression and furthermore, that G1/S checkpoint override coincides with the transition from melanoma in situ to invasive melanoma. This latter point was corroborated by the observations Mark Zeng made with his [CRISPR engineered human melanoma model system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535610818302289) published back-to-back.
