This paper was the result of a fun and fruitful collaboration between the Blelloch and Derynck labs. Led by Deepa Subramanyam (who now runs her [own lab](http://www.nccs.res.in/DeepaS.html)), the team translated our previous findings regarding the reprogramming potential of miR-302 from mouse to human cells, then delves into the mechanism for the first time by both identifying a handful of new targets, and demonstrating that miR-302 is a potent inhibitor of TGF-Beta signaling, which, in turn regulates transitions between mesenchymal and epithelial cell states. I had the opportunity to help spearhead the TGF-Beta experiments with Samy Lamouille from Rikâ€™s lab, and learned a great deal in the process.
