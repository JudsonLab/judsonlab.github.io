I have been excited about the potential of digital holographic cytometry (DHC) for years. This imaging technique allows you to acquire beautiful videos of living mammalian cells without the need for any sort of labeling regent and it is completely non-toxic.  In addition, the morphological features we derive from these images can be used to classify different cell states. In the past, this has worked really well for determining whether entire populations of cells are morphologically distinct, but it has been difficult to achieve high accuracies with single cell resolution. We wanted to monitor complex cell populations undergoing transitions over long periods of time, where four or more distinct and semi-stable cell states might exist at any point in time. In this study, we teamed up with Miro Hejna and Jun Song – experts in big data and machine learning – and established a computational pipeline that allows us to turn a series of DHC holographic images as pictured above into “rocket plots” as pictured below – with each row following a cell, its morphology and its behavior through time.  Thank you to [PHI](http://www.phiab.se/) for working with us on this project.
