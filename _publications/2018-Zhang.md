Digital holographic imaging (and specifically the holomonitor which lives full time in a standard mammalian cell incubator) offers some key advantages when working with primary human cells. First - the technology is label free, which means they can be imaged without manipulation such as dyes, transduction, or clonal selection. Second - the imaging is conducted in standard growth conditions - including standard plates and medias. Third - the light used is completely non-toxic. This has allowed us to obtain quite a bit of useful information from primary human cells (motility, cell cycle length, morphology, measurements of heterogeneity and plasticity) as they are being derived and expanded or during their standard culture and still have all of the cells left over for further experiments. Here, Helen conducted a series of in parallel analyses to see how our holographic measurements compared to more conventional methods. She found that measuring cell motility using DHC gave the same interpretations as measuring cell migration using a transwell assay.
