This review explores the rapidly expanding intersection of microRNA biology and pluripotency, with specific focuses on microRNA regulation of i) early mammalian development, ii) pluripotent stem cell maintenance & differentiation, and iii) somatic cell reprogramming. Figure 4 shown above needs updated with the miR-181 family and about two dozen validated ESCC & miR-181 targets.
