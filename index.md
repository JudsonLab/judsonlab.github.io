Our lab is interested in identifying and characterizing factors that stabilize cell state. Each cell in the human body occupies a specific functional state based upon its location, developmental history, environment, and molecular landscape. Transitions from these states can have potentially dangerous outcomes, such as tumorigenesis. Cells can undergo state transitions either through acquiring irreversible genetic mutations or through epigenetic reprogramming stimulated by environmental factors. Non-coding microRNAs are thought to be buffers of cell state - stabilizing a cell against transitions. We use a microRNA-based approach to dissect networks of interacting genes that act as barriers to mutation-induced or environmentally-induced transitions.  Specifically, we are focused on multigenic interactions that prevent normal melanocytes and benign melanocytic lesions from acquiring more embryonic or tumorigenic programs.
