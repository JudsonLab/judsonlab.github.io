# Regulation of Cell State Stability

Our lab is interested in identifying and characterizing factors that stabilize cell state. Each cell in the human body occupies a specific functional state based upon its location, developmental history, environment, and molecular landscape. Alterations to these factors can destabilize a cellâ€™s molecular program and result in the transition from one functional state to another. Misregulation of cell state can be dangerous for the organism, such as in tumorigenesis

#### A marriage of many factors

We focus on characterizing a variety of factors that alter cell state - such as irreversible genetic mutations, shifts in the microenvironment, or stochastic bursts in transcription. We analyze both the individual contribution of each alteration, as well as how these events come together to influence cell state.

#### MicroRNA regulation of stability


One major focus is the role of non-coding microRNAs, which are regulators of gene expression. The acquisition and diversification of microRNA coding regions in the genome paralleled the development and stratification of complex body plans, suggesting a critical role for these sequences in the differentiation and stability of specific tissues. We and others have demonstrated that microRNAs confer robustness onto cell state - they can both stabilize phenotypes associated with the cell type of origin, or, conversely, destabilize phenotypes associated with other cell types. As buffers of cell state, the study of microRNAs and the genetic networks they regulate is a valuable approach for dissecting the mechanisms of both in vitro cell state manipulation (reprogramming, stem cell differentiation) and human diseases involving phenotype switching (tumorigenesis).
