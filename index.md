# Engineering Melanoma Brick by Brick

The development and progression of melanoma is an extraordinarily complex process. Decades of research have revealed dozens of molecular changes and interactions critical for the transition – from point mutations to epigenetic reprogramming to cell-cell interactions.  However, no single one of these events provides us with the necessary knowledge to invariably prevent or predict the development of the disease or to abolish it once it has progressed.
Our goal is to move toward a complete understanding of human melanoma by engineering its progression in vitro, piece by piece, inside and out, and use this knowledge to drive discoveries in prevention, diagnostics & treatment. Beginning with primary human melanocytes, we strive to engineer both the genetic mutations that drive melanoma and the microenvironment of human skin. We use this system to ask:

- What is the oncogenic penetrance of each melanoma-associated mutation?
- Define the factors that drive or stabilize each cell program from normal melanocyte to malignant melanoma, including:
<br />
o	Transcription Factors
<br />
o	microRNAs
<br />
o	Genetic Background
- Investigate the role of stochasticity and plasticity in melanoma progression
