Thank you to everyone who attended our first [Holographic Time-lapse Imaging Cytometry Seminar](http://www.phiab.se/centers/ucsf), and especially to our speakers: Mikael Sebesta from PHI, Ed Luther from Northeastern University and Felix Bestvater from the German Cancer Research Center. We found the event to be extremely useful for our continued development of phase shift based quantitative cytometry and hope others found it interesting as well.
