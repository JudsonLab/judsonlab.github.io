We are honored and excited to have received a team science award from the [Marcus Program in Precision Medicine Innovation](http://support.ucsf.edu/news/bold-innovation-program-fast-tracks-precision-medicine-research). With this funding, we will initiate a collaborative effort with Dr. Maria Wei and Dr. Dexter Hadley to develop novel methods of non-invasive monitoring of moles for their malignant potential. Our sincere gratitude to George and Judy Marcus for their generous and visionary funding of high risk high reward efforts in precision medicine.
