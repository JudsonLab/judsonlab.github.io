We just received [notification](http://www.curemelanoma.org/research/mra-research-awards/team-science/)  that our team science award on developing rational therapeutic approaches for acral melanoma is being funded. Truly on the shoulders of giants, we are honored to begin working with Dr. Bastian, Dr. Dummer and Dr. Yeh on this research program that will hopefully provide much needed insight into the driving mechanisms and potential treatment of acral melanoma.
