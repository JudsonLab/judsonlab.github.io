Congratulations to Maria Wei on the winning pitch for the [impact award](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2017/06/407376/artificial-intelligence-melanoma-detector-wins-cancer-center-impact-grant)! We are excited to be working with you and Mike Keiser to test the diagnostic potential of our non-invasive melanoma screening tools.
